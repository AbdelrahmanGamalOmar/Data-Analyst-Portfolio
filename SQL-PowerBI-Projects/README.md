# SQL + Power BI Projects

This folder contains projects where I used **SQL** for data analysis and **Power BI** for data visualization. Each project demonstrates my ability to extract insights from data and present them in an interactive and visually appealing way.

## Projects



## How to Use This Folder
- Each project folder contains:
  - A `README.md` with detailed project information.
