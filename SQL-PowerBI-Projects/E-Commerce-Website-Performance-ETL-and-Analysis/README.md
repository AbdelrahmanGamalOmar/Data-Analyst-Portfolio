The project is organized into three main components:

1. ETL Process (Python and Pandas)
*Objective: Extract, and load data from JSON and CSV files into a MySQL database.

Steps:

* Extract: Read data from JSON and CSV files using Pandas.
* Load: Insert the cleaned data into a MySQL database for further analysis.

Files:

3. Power BI Dashboard
Objective: Visualize key metrics and trends to enable data-driven decision-making.

Key Visualizations:

* Sales performance (total revenue, orders, and margins).

* Customer segmentation (new vs. repeat customers).

* Traffic source effectiveness (paid vs. organic, device type).

* Seasonal trends (monthly and weekly trends).

Files:
