# Netflix Content Analysis and Visualization - Power BI Project

This project analyzes **Netflix's movie and TV show catalog** to uncover trends in content production, release patterns, and viewer preferences. The goal is to provide actionable insights for content strategy, audience targeting, and operational efficiency. The analysis leverages **Power BI** for visualization and **SQL/Python** for data cleaning and transformation.

## Key Features of the Analysis and Visualization

### **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
- Identified columns with null values and assessed potential biases in the dataset.
- Separated **movie duration (minutes)** and **TV show duration (seasons)** for granular analysis.
- Added new columns: `month_added` and `season_added` to analyze release timing trends.

### **Content Production Insights**
- Identified the **highest-producing countries** in Netflix's catalog.
- Calculated **max, min, and average duration** for movies and TV shows.
- Analyzed the **count of each rating** (e.g., PG-13, TV-MA) to understand content maturity distribution.

### **Release Trends**
- Determined which **year, season, and month** had the most movie and TV show releases.
- Visualized seasonal patterns in content releases to optimize future launch schedules.

### **Geographic and Demographic Analysis**
- Analyzed **average duration of movies and TV shows by country** to identify regional preferences.
- Explored the relationship between **duration of titles** and their **rating** (e.g., longer movies vs. specific ratings).
