Covid Analysis using SQL and PowerBi

This project presents an analysis of COVID-19 data utilizing SQL queries and PowerBi. The analysis focuses on examining various aspects of the pandemic, including total cases, deaths, infection percentages, vaccination rates, and more. By querying a dataset containing COVID-19 statistics, insights are derived to better understand the global impact of the virus.

I would like to acknowledge and express my gratitude to Alex The Analyst for their invaluable guidance and instruction in SQL.
The SQL code in this project is based on the concepts and techniques taught in his video.
Their expertise and clear explanations greatly contributed to my understanding and proficiency in SQL.

It's important to note that the PowerBi portion of this project was solely developed by me, building upon the SQL foundation provided by the instructor.
